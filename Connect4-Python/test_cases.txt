in each test, check win rate and running time

1. run with different board sizes,
2. run with different number of agents
3. run 2 minimax agents, each with different searching depth tree
4. check minmax with the simpler heuristic
5. compare run times with previous noobs work.
6. run connect 4 3d(?)


- debug minmax with depth 2 - itamar
- run shalom's run with more games (maybe try the cnn then) - aboud
- maybe train rl with master with depth 2 - aboud
- modify baseline players to be probabilistic - shalom
- generalize rl to work on 3d board
- generalize rl to work with different indices
- generalize rl to work with multiple player
- work on the report, add results section
- ui to 3d
