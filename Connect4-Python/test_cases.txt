in each test, check win rate and running time

1. run with different board sizes,
2. run with different number of agents
3. run 2 minimax agents, each with different searching depth tree
4. check minmax with the simpler heuristic
5. compare run times with previous noobs work.
6. run connect 4 3d(?)
